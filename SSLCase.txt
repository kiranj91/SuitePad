Sometimes we might get requests from Unknown Certificate, its not recommended to continue with the request since it may not be trustable.
To avoid that, we can use TrustManager Interface and can make the system to trust and accept a specific set of CAs. 
We can use onReceivedSslError method to catch the requests where we encounter SSL requests which are not from a known CA, and handle them 
or continue with the request.
